# Densha de GO! Final - English Translation Patch

English Translation Patch for in-game UI text. 

The aim of this project is to make the game even more accessible by removing the difficulties brought into place by the language barrier. This patch targets the Unbalance published PC version of the game, but will hopefully also be available for use on the Densha de GO! Plug & Play.

This project would not have been possible without the great work done by GMMan on libdgf.
